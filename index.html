				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>My name is Michaela Azzinaro and I am a sophomore here at the University of South Carolina. I currently live with my three best friends in five points and it makes being so far from home worth it. I came to this school because I love football more than any other sport and need warm weather. Coming to this school has satisfied both of my major needs along with many more.</p>
				<p id="about" class="hidden">I am originally from Rhode Island where I live ten minutes from the beach. Being so close all my life keeps me on the east coast where I am comfortable and have everything I need. I have 4 other siblings putting me smack in the middle of 5. My parents and the rest of my family is very close so being far away is hard but manageable due to FaceTime. We all play volleyball and I would say that is one of my favorite things to do on my free time.</p>

				<h3>My Future Career Plans</h3>
				<p>Since I started here I have been a biology major and do not plan on changing that. I chose this major because in all my years of school, science is the one class that kept me on my toes and interested. I also enjoy this field because it is always growing and there is always new things to learn. For most of my life I wanted to be a surgeon or pediatrician because I watched Greys Anatomy and thought that I would enjoy that. Now, I have realized that is not the field I want to go into because I want to enjoy my life and have more freedom.</p>
				<p id="future" class="hidden">So, I have leaned away from medical school and have focused more on specialized graduate school. As of right now I am very interested in optometry and want to try to get into one of those schools around the country once finished with undergrad. There is around thirteen optometry schools around the country and I can not decide if I want to move back home or stay in the south. Other options are physical therapy school, dentistry school, PA school, nursing ect. But, when the time comes I will make a decision and look forward to my future in the biological science field.</p>
